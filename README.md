# On Track
This project project is meant to be a project tracker with built in functionality for a kanban board (glorified todo list), a notes section, and possibly a sources/references section.

*The Problem:*
Many students struggle to find a method of taking notes that allows them to keep an easily accessible record/log of all their findings in one place. Many differing tools are often strung together in order to fill this, rather than there just being one.

*The Purpose:*
It is primarilly designed to fulfill a note taking functionality for students having to write research papers. The kanban board will allow them to keep track of what they need to do. The notes can literally contain an essay as they write it, and lastly the references section will allow them to add their sources to the board as well.

*The Target Audience:*
The primary target audience is university students. However, it will also have potential applications for other positions such as reserch assistants, general project management in multiple sectors, etc.
